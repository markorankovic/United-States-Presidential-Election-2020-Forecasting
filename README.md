# United States Presidential Election 2020 Forecasting

Swift Playgrounds in this repository were used to calculate the potential fate of Biden and Trump during the 2020 U.S. Election.

`CurrentElectoralColleges` - Calculates the number of electoral colleges both candidates would have if they were to win their leading states at the point in time.

`RemainingVotesCalculator` - Calculates the percentage that either candidate would need to win of the remaining votes to be counted in order for the two to equalize.

## Examples

At about 13:00 PT on 4th of November, results from `CurrentElectoralColleges` showed that Arizona and Nevada would be just enough for Biden to win.

Using `RemainingVotesCalculator`, I saw two hours before the call that Trump would need to win 93% of the remaining Pennsylvania votes to equalize with Biden.
